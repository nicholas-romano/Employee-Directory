## Installation 
1.  Install node: go to nodejs.org and download latest version and walk through the installation instructions.  
2.  Go to project folder and enter: npm install to install all dependencies in the package.json file.  
3.  Run server on port 3000 by entering npm start.  
 
## Usage 
1.  When the application loads up, a list of 50 employees is generated using artificial personal data from the Random user API -  [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) and the user will see a blue heading with a title and brief instructions on how to interact with the user interface. ![Employee-Directory-Heading](/public/images/Employee-Directory-Heading.png) 
2.  Typing in the search box below the heading will filter the list by only displaying the employee name that contain the search letters entered. For example, typing the letters “ca” will filter the list of users to only display those that have a “ca” in their names. ![Employee-Directory-Search-Box-Filter](/public/images/Employee-Directory-Search-Box-Filter.png) 
3.  Clicking on the “Name” column heading in the table will sort the displayed list in alphabetical order. The black down arrow next to the column heading indicates that it sorted the list alphabetically. ![Employee-Directory-Alpha-Order](/public/images/Employee-Directory-Alpha-Order.png)
4.  Clicking this heading again will sort the list in reverse alphabetical order displaying a black up arrow next to the heading rather than the down arrow. ![Employee-Directory-Reverse-Alpha-Sort](/public/images/Employee-Directory-Reverse-Alpha-Sort.png) All subsequent clicks on this heading will toggle the list between alphabetical order and reverse alphabetical order.
